<a href="http://www.skype.com/download/skype/macosx/beta/">Skype Beta for Mac OS X version 2.8</a> adds screen sharing, and it's easy to use -- but screen sharing is only available on the Mac version of Skype.

Until they port screen sharing to Windows and Linux, <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">teamviewer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vnc">VNC</a> will have to make do.
