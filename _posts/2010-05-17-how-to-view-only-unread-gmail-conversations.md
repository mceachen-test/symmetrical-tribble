Gmail doesn't have an obvious way to only look at conversations that are unread. If you don't "archive" conversations out of your inbox, it can get pretty crufty.

It's easy add a bookmark to just view unread conversations, however:

<!--more-->

For gmail accounts, bookmark this URL: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#search/label%3Aunread">https://mail.google.com/mail/#search/label%3Aunread</a>

If you're using Firefox or Google Chrome, you can drag this link to your bookmark toolbar: <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#search/label%3Aunread">View Unread Email</a>

For google apps accounts,
<ol>
	<li>Enter "label:unread" into the top search field</li>
	<li>Bookmark the resulting page. The URL will look like "https://mail.google.com/a/<strong><em>yourdomain</em></strong>/#search/label%3Aunread"</li>
</ol>
This was the first thing my wife asked for when she switched to a new computer, so at least for her, it's helpful!
