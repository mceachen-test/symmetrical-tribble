Quick nifty tip: To run exposé for all windows for a specific application, either "long click" an application icon in the dock, or hold down the command key, hit tab until you're highlighting the application you want to pick a window from, and click the down cursor key. You'll see an exposé view for the windows for that application.

Still holding command down, If you hit tab again, you'll see exposé for the next application. The current application will be highlighted in the dock.

Neat, eh?
