I finally got around to trying out <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a> (one of the apps I got from MacHeist a while ago), and it's a brilliant and simple todo app.

You enter something like this:
<pre>Inbox:
- Put camera in car
- Put pizza stone in car
Groceries:
- Milk
- Eggs
- Pizza toppings
Yard work:
- Rake leaves
- Put away hose @done
- Clean up garden @done</pre>
And you get a GUI treatment that looks like this:

It's <a href="/blog/must-have-mac-os-x-tools">one of my must-have applications now</a>.
