In rebuilding <a href="http://photostructure.com/">PhotoStructure</a> on Rails, I was surprised that one of the most popular gem for trees used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model">nested set model</a>. Nested sets are performant for reads, but for adding and deleting nodes, it's <strong>extremely</strong> expensive -- on average, half of the rows for your model acting as a nested set have to be updated for every add or delete. <strong>That's crazy-talk!</strong> It requires a table-level lock for something that, at least for PhotoStructure, is a very common task. To top it off, the gem doesn't even do the lock!

<a href="http://matthew.mceachen.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hier-table-design.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1132" title="hier-table-design" src="http://matthew.mceachen.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hier-table-design-300x166.png" alt="" width="300" height="166" /></a>I then found the <a href="https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry">ancestory</a> gem, which works by materializing the ancestral path as a string and storing that as a column. <a href="http://karwin.blogspot.com/">Bill Karwin's</a> excellent <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data">Models for hierarchical data presentation</a> describes this as the Path Enumeration algorithm, which doesn't have referential integrity, and relies on performant LIKE selects.

As the tag hierarchies in PhotoStructure are never moved, closure trees should prove to be ideal. It's an excellent excuse to <a href="http://asciicasts.com/episodes/183-gemcutter-jeweler">learn</a> <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/gem_docs">how</a> to <a href="http://blog.thepete.net/2010/11/creating-and-publishing-your-first-ruby.html">build and publish</a> a rails plugin gem, so I've built a new gem to support closure trees, and I named it "closure_tree".
