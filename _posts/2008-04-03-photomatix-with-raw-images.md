We got to visit the Yosemite valley a couple weekends ago, and as I was gaping and smiling at all the grandeur, I tried RAW one more time.

When I got home, though, iPhoto's conversion was disappointing:

I did some research and found <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/">Photomatix</a> -- and on the same RAW image, I couldn't believe it was from the same input! It's easy:
<ol>
	<li>Find the name of the RAW image  (you can get the filename in iPhoto by hitting <strong>&#x2318;-i</strong> when the image is selected)</li>
	<li><code>File > Open File...</code>, and type the name of the image into the search box. If you have a Canon camera, the file suffix will be <code>.cr2</code></li>
	<li>click the "Details Enhancer" button:</li>
</ol>

HDR without a tripod! w00t!
