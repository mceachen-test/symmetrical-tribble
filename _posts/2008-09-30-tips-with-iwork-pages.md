If you're writing a book, new chapters need to start on the top of the next right page.

To do this in openoffice, you Insert > Break, choose "Page", then hidden under the "Styles" menu there's a "Right Page".

To do this in Apple's iWork Pages, you insert a new section break -- and at the bottom of the section inspector there's a "Section starts on:" pulldown.
