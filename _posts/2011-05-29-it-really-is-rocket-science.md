This last Friday I taught my "it really is rocket science" class to another hundred children (Kindergarten through 5th grade). <a href="http://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/1077-hands-on-arts-and-science-education">Last year PTO Today wrote an article about Arts and Science day</a>, and interviewed me. This year, the kids were great, I had tons of help, and the new rocket launcher designs let the kids experiment with different pressures and different launch angles. Good stuff!

The launcher design is almost exactly from <a href="http://www.sciencetoymaker.org/waterRocket/buildWaterRocketLauncher.htm" target="_blank">Slater Harrison's awesome overhead water rockets</a>. Thanks!
