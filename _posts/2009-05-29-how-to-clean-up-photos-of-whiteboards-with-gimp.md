It's basically unreadable. I looked for a good recipe to clean this up in gimp, but the googles failed me. 

<div style="clear:both"></div>
After playing with a bunch of stuff with the gimp, here are the steps that I've found to work pretty well:
<ol>
	<li>Load the image in <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a></li>
	<li style="clear:both">Now for the magicks: Choose Filters &gt;Edge Detect &gt; Difference of Gaussians...<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-409" title="diff-of-gauss" src="http://matthew.mceachen.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/diff-of-gauss.png" alt="diff-of-gauss" width="281" height="150" /></li>
	<li style="clear:both">Start with these settings. It doesn't make it perfect, but it should make the lines stand out much better. Play around with the radius 1 and radius 2 values if you aren't happy. Radius 1 needs to be bigger than Radius 2. Click OK.</li>
	<li style="clear:both"><img src="http://matthew.mceachen.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/final-levels.png" alt="final-levels" title="final-levels" width="301" height="368" class="alignright size-full wp-image-411" /> Return toÂ  Colors &gt; Levels... and move both the blackpoint and the midpoint to the right (to make the lines stand out) and the whitepoint to the left just a bit (to make the whiteboard white). Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<div style="clear:both"></div>

Here's the result:
