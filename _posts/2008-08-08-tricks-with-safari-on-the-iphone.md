If you click the time bar at the top of the screen, safari will quickly scroll to the top of the frame where the location field is, set the focus to the location field, and expose the search field as well.

Double-tapping in safari alternatively zooms into a block of text or zooms back to fit-width-to-page. Two-finger pinch-zoom works too, which can help in filling out forms (like google's search box).
