YouTube has many videos in better resolution, but doesn't have an easy link to the better video. The URL to the video is easy -- just add <code>&amp;fmt=18</code> to the end of it -- but doing that by hand is kindof a pain.

A simple GreaseMonkey script makes it easy and automatic, though!
<ol>
	<li>Use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a></li>
	<li>Install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">GreaseMonkey</a></li>
	<li>Install <a href="/geek/youtube-fmt-18.user.js">youtube-fmt-18.user.js</a></li>
</ol>

 <strong><em>Remember to always view the source of any greasemonkey script you install (including this one). Never install scripts where you don't clearly see what it's doing. This one's nice and simple, though.</em></strong>
